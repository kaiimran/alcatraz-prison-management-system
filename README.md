# Alcatraz Prison Management System
Password: warden

# Introduction
The main purpose of building this system is to help smoother the prison’s daily operations and to store all the information of prisoners to be kept in an innovative way, secured and accurate data integrity.

The program will centralize all the records of prisoners across the country, that will share a common database so that the records can be accessed from any prison. This is to avoid duplication of records and prisoners do not need to bring along their big files anymore when they are transferred to other prison. It will be so easy to use that even the prison staff with low knowledge in computers will be able to search, sort and view the records.

Most prisons are still using an old-fashioned way of recording using a log book and big-old files. When they want to look for information on prisoners or making an update, they will have to look through the archive according to the assumed date the information was stored and then look through all the files that were recorded on the same period one by one until the file is found. This method can be inefficient, time-consuming and troublesome for the staff. It can also can be easily manipulated by anyone since there is little to no security for the files stored. That is why using this management system, whenever you want to edit, update or delete records, you will be asked for password which is only known by the administrator in charge.

Besides, there are a lot of cases in which the prison lost some prisoners’ data and there are a lot of inaccurate records due to improper way of recording data. There are even a few cases where the prisoners are released later, exceeding their period of imprisonment either because of loss of data or the staff overlooked the records. With the development of this system, we hope the mistakes will be minimized and there will be more improvement in the management of prisons.

# Objectives
1. To manage the daily prison operations with a system that can store, update and retrieve records quickly.
2. To record all the prisoners’ name, cell numbers, prison block, type of crimes and period of imprisonment (date to be released).
3. To ease the process of looking for a specific prisoner’s record without the need to look for it in the full list by searching for their name or prison ID. Later, the user can update the prisoners’ record by editing their status (locked up, freed, on parole) OR update their new cell numbers after being transferred.
4. To sort the prisoners by their name in ascending order and display a list of all prisoners with their records.
5. To assign the prisoners to a specific jail block (Maximum-Security Block for heavy crimes, General Population Block, Special Unit Block for crimes involving women/children as a victim) according to their type of crimes.
6. To filter the full list by only displaying prisoners with a specific crime that the user wants (e.g. List of prisoners charged with ‘Homicide’) OR a list of all the prisoners inside a specific block.
7. To find the minimum period of imprisonment left among the prisoners since he will be the earliest one to be released soon.
8. To find the longest-serving prisoner with maximum years spent in the jail according to the date their sentence started.
9. To calculate the average of period of imprisonment for each type of crime.
10. To count the total number of prisoners in a prison block (Maximum-Security Block, General Population Block, Special Unit Block) OR total prisoners for a type of crime.
